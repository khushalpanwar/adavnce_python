#    Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?

""" 
Yes, in Python, you can use a single except block to handle multiple 
exceptions by specifying them as a tuple inside the except statement. 
This approach allows you to group similar exception types together and 
handle them with the same block of code. Hereâ€™s how you can handle multiple 
exceptions in a single except block:
"""

try:
    # Code that might raise exceptions
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
    # Handle both ZeroDivisionError and ValueError
    print("Error: Invalid input or division by zero!")
except IOError:
    # Handle IOError separately
    print("Error: An IOError occurred.")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any other exceptions not caught above
    print(f"Error: An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}")
else:
    # Execute if no exceptions were raised
    print(f"Result: {result}")
finally:
    # Always execute after try/except, regardless of exceptions
    print("Execution complete.")
